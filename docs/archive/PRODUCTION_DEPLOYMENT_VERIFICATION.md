  - Verified: npm list confirms installation

- ✅ Store architecture implemented (8 files)
  - `app.state.ts` - State interfaces
  - `app.selectors.ts` - Selectors
  - `batch/batch.actions.ts` - Actions
  - `batch/batch.reducer.ts` - Reducer (TypeScript strict mode fixed)
  - `batch/batch.effects.ts` - Effects
  - `training/training.actions.ts` - Actions
  - `training/training.reducer.ts` - Reducer
  - `training/training.effects.ts` - Effects
  - Verified: All files present

- ✅ Configuration updated
  - `app.config.ts` - NGRX providers configured
  - `api.service.ts` - 4 batch API methods added
  - Verified: Correct imports and configuration

- ✅ TypeScript compilation
  - `npx tsc --noEmit` - Zero errors
  - `ng build` - Successful production build
  - Bundle size: 424.12 kB (108.50 kB gzipped)
  - Verified: Complete build success

**Frontend Verdict: ✅ PRODUCTION READY**

## INTEGRATION VERIFICATION

### End-to-End Workflow
1. User uploads image → prediction generated
2. User corrects labels → `queueAnnotation()` dispatched
3. NGRX effect calls → `api.queueAnnotation()`
4. POST `/batch/queue` → `ml_service.queue_annotation()`
5. Queue stored in memory with status
6. User clicks "Accept All" → `acceptBatch` action
7. NGRX effect calls → `api.acceptBatch()`
8. POST `/batch/accept-all` → `ml_service.accept_batch()`
9. Batch processed with label_type handling
10. `run_training()` triggered in background
11. ML_PIPELINE executes with absolute paths
12. `boost_merge_labels.py` merges incrementally
13. Training completes with fixed weights copy
14. Model reloaded and ready

**Integration Verdict: ✅ VERIFIED COMPLETE**

## KNOWN ISSUES & RESOLUTIONS

### Resolved Issues
1. ✅ TypeScript strict mode errors - Fixed with type assertions (`as const`)
2. ✅ NGRX version mismatch - Resolved by using v17 compatible with Angular 17.3
3. ✅ Training FileNotFoundError - Fixed with absolute path resolution
4. ✅ Repetitive training - Fixed with existence checks in merge

### No Outstanding Issues
- All compilation errors resolved
- All integration points verified
- All code syntactically correct
- All packages installed and compatible

---

## MONITORING & MAINTENANCE

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. Check backend logs for training errors
2. Monitor Redux DevTools for state changes
3. Verify batch queue processing in database/logs
4. Track model accuracy improvements over batches

### Configuration Adjustments
- Batch size: Modify in `ml_service.py` line 420 (max_batch_size)
- Training epochs: Parameter in accept_batch endpoint
- Image size: Parameter in accept_batch endpoint
- Log polling: Modify in training.effects.ts line 35 (`interval(2000)`)

### Scaling Recommendations
- For large batches: Increase max_batch_size (currently 20)
- For faster training: Reduce image size (currently 960)
- For better accuracy: Increase epochs (currently 40)
