"""
File: boost_merge_labels.py

Purpose:
Takes human-reviewed active learning annotations and merges them
into the primary training dataset layout before retraining.

Reads from:
- ML/data/test_images/ (or whatever TEST_IMAGE_FOLDER is configured to)
- ML/active_labels/
- ML/wrong_labels/

Writes to:
- ML/data/yolo_merged/ (the combined ultimate training directory)

# no objects, reinforcing it as a negative sample.
